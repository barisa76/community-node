# The TRON Community Node Project


On May 31, 2018, Tron Labs will launch the Main Net and thus transition the TRX cryptocurrency away from the Ethereum blockchain to one managed by Tron Labs. Beginning On June 25th, the TRX coinholders will vote in daily elections to choose 27 organizations to run their blockchain network. These organizations will become Super Representatives who operate computer servers called 'nodes.'

Tron Labs will pay these nodes 32 TRX coins for every block of data produced. The 27 nodes will take turns creating these blocks at the rate of 1 per second, or about 2 blocks each per minute.

That's a little more than 2,750,000 TRX per day at an average of about 100,000 TRX per Super Representative.

The Super Representatives will earn TRX daily, but in order to maintain elected power those Super Representatives must provide benefits to the TRX voters who elected them. In addition to benefitting the Tron community with support initiatives, a Super Representative may wish to share its rewards directly with the TRX voters who elect it every day. 

We have formed a group of people to participate in one of these Super Representative organizations. Several other groups have formed with similar intentions, with different rewards plans being developed. Anticipating this, we have set this project apart from the others by proposing an **open source** structure for the management and ownership of the organization.

To run a Super Representative node, the Tron Foundation recommends a technical budget of $40,000 per month - a substantial investment for a startup. I have devised a plan to bootstrap our operation and to start I am paying out of pocket for the server's introductory level operation.  I have a plan to scale the server size according to its growing predominance, and have already increased the provisioning twice. If we are elected to one of these exclusive Super Representative posts I will be able to scale up what I believe will be a reasonably acceptable server instance within 10 minutes.

This will be our test for viability of the server.  If it succeeds, then we get to move on to the next phase of the plan. If it is woefully inadequate and fails to produce blocks when given the chance, then I will have lost a small sum and a considerable amount of time.

Our first priority will be forming a registered non profit foundation to run the organization. 

If the node is successful in earning block rewards, we will implement a voter rewards program. Please take a moment to review our [Rewards Proposal](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node/blob/master/doc/rewards_plan.md).

In a nutshell, while some Super Representatives will choose to reward the voters who elected them, we will create a market for buying votes.

The organization will have several responsibilities, both social and financial. Primarily it must maintain a reliable Full Node on the TRON blockchain. After core expenses are met, the community has several long-term considerations. 

The Tron ecosystem will rely on application developers to create a need for TRX coins. Without applications, our investment in TRX will languish and become worthless. As partners in the Tron foundation, a Super Representative must be proactive in developing the Tron community through advocacy, advertisement, and applications. Spending money on these initiatives is not altruism, it is a self-serving gesture for the benefit of all TRX coinholders. We will prioritize the development of these initiatives in the early days of Tron main net so as to drive excitement and public awareness for the project.

After these responsibilities have been met, we can open our treasury to the voters who make it possible for us to continue operations, sending them TRX rewards as a dividend for their participation.

Our Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. We expect other cryptocurrencies to use Tron's open source application as a starting point for their blockchain networks, as well as Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours.

We chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a resource for those who come after us. We are indeed pioneers in a brave new world and many will follow in our footsteps. Let us light their way.

You are encouraged to join us and become a part of our group. It's people just like you who we want to include in this effort. Thanks!

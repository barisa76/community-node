|Location of company| Washington D.C. |
|Expected location of servers| Atlanta GA |
|Server type| Cloud VM |
|Expenditure budget and technical plan| Our Beta configuration will be in effect until June 26, and consists of 24 GB RAM, 8 CPU Cores, 40/2	 	Gbps Network I/O. Total expenses until June 26 = $235 |
|Hardware capacity upgrade plan| On June 25 we will launch a Production level server with 200 GB RAM, 16 CPU Cores, 2 TB SSD Storage, and 40/10 Gbps Network I/O. With bandwidth costs added, Monthly expense is $31,000. We are currently researching upgrade options, with a minimum of 3 server instances behind a load balancer. Another option is a parallel computing solution which would allow us to run a cluster of server instances with nearly unlimited resources. |
|Community development plan| Our plan for community development begins with providing services to the community. We have created a staging network which is a replica of the Tron network and will allow the community to test their newly created dapps before deploying them to the Tron main net. We will also have an open source, downloadable dapp game they can use for testing this functionality. We have also opened a Tron Main Net help group on Telegram. Additionally, we are holding a contest for the best main net java dapp game, prize is 10,240 TRX payable from our node's first day of block rewards. Good for 10 dapp uploads on the Tron main net. |

After the dot com bust he worked on the U.S. Congressional campaign of Andrew Horne, first as a volunteer who maintained the website and broadcasted emails, eventually writing copy and working directly with the communications team in a salaried position. From there, he formed Campaign Kickstart, a grassroots incubator, and developed an advocacy program for the Louisville Affordable Housing Trust Fund's Open the Door campaign (the legislature passed!).

**`• Company information:`**  
The Community Node organization is an open source collaboration in the blockchain space. 

Our Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. The Tron project itself is open source, and we expect other cryptocurrencies to use the Tron application as a starting point for their blockchain networks. Other Distributed Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies may adopt Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours. We chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a resource for those who come after us.

By sharing our IT strategies, it is our hope to strengthen the entire blockchain industry and advance the determination of best practices.

Our movement is still young and we are actively trying to bring in new members.

We are also active on Reddit [r/tronix]((http://reddit.com/r/tronix)).



**`• Community Support Plan for 2018`**  
We have created a staging network which is a replica of the Tron network and which will allow the community to practice with wallets and to beta test the behavior of newly created dapps. [It is already working in alpha](https://twitter.com/bondibox/status/991872321559261184) with 2 witnesses and 2 seed nodes.  We will continue the expansion of our test net to include solidity nodes and web wallets.

We will create a How To demonstration for a simple dapp game that flips a coin and pays tokens when guessed correctly. Users can upload this dapp to the staging network to experience the same functionality as the Tron main net.

We have entered into a strategic partnership with the Sesame Seeds SR Group to provide community support on a broader level than either of us is able to provide on our own. Together we are operating a [TRON Help Group](https://t.me/TronHelp) at Telegram to answer questions related to the Tron main net. 

We have contributed to the Tron Wiki and have pushed one set of changes.  

In keeping with our open source ideology, we will also be pooling our collective knowledge and establishing best practices for the rest of the SR community, and we will publish that information in a fork of the Official Tron documentation.





**`• Community promotion efforts`**   
We are holding a contest for the best main net java dapp, prize is 10,240 TRX payable from our node's first day of block rewards. Good for 10 dapp uploads on the Tron main net.

Chief Technical Officer / Founder  
> Jason Neely has maintained a *nix server almost constantly since 1998 when he installed RedHat and QTSS on his iMac. Soon after, he began work as an Apple Retail Representative, then went on to be a Tier 2 technician for Darwin Networks where he became Cisco certified. After the dot com bust he worked on the U.S. Congressional campaign of Andrew Horne, first as a volunteer who maintained the website and broadcasted emails, eventually writing copy and working directly with the communications team in a salaried position. From there, he formed Campaign Kickstart, a grassroots incubator, and developed an advocacy program for the Louisville Affordable Housing Trust Fund's Open the Door campaign (the legislature passed!). For the past 10 years he has been studying OOP and considers himself to be one of the last few Ruby on Rails enthusiasts.  


WAN Strategist  
> Greg is a SysAdmin for a leading Aerospace Manufacturer with over 90,000 users located around the globe. Over the past 12 years Greg has worked his way up the IT ladder learning many different products, software, and systems along the way. He currently holds a Bachelor in Networks and Communication and is near to completing his Technology focused MBA. Greg is an avid believer in the Tron Network Project and is excited to witness and be involved with its creation.

Application Education    
>  Colradi is a computer engineer in love with blockchain. He worked as an IT consultant and Java teacher for (too) many years in Madrid. Now he enjoys the inner peace of the mediterranean ocean, near Barcelona, and spends his days involved in a neverending Javascript project.

UX Designer
> Duane Harrison is a lead designer for one of the world’s largest airlines. Prior to this he has worked with a number of startups, overseeing and contributing to the design of mobile and web apps, one of which has featured in Apple’s WWDC keynote. Now based in Hong Kong, he is looking towards digital transformation in the financial space and sees huge potential in future applications that build on the Tron network.

**`• Budget Expenditure and Technical Plan before June 26, 2018`**  
$15          	. . .		Domain Registration CommunityNode.org  
$20          	. . .		 May 1 - May 28 alpha configuration  
$200         	. . .		 May 29 - June 26 beta configuration  
9,999 TRX  	. . .		 Super Representative Application Fee  
									------------------  
$235 + 9,999 TRX = Total expenses May 1 - June 26



The recommended configuration is an Amazon AWS x1.16xlarge with 25 Gbps network i/o but we have found a hosting service with a OC768 incoming network connection, offering 40 Gbps in and 10 Gbps out. We believe that the incoming network connection will be critical for the Super Representative nodes, and the outbound connection will be used more with the Full Nodes. Therefore we believe there exists the potential for this service to be superlative to the de facto standard.

The largest configuration available at this host is 32 core / 196 GB RAM. We will compare this against AWS and will use whichever service performs better.


**`• Plans for hardware expansion`**  


We are currently researching the building of a cluster of server instances running in parallel for nearly unlimited resources, as well as adding docker, kubernetes, and hadoop replication and deployment services.

Since AWS has a higher outbound network connection than our main node, we will deploy Full nodes on AWS as data slaves.
